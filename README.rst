and external backups should be kept, automatically!

Want to go even further and write your backups to an external server?
You can with this module! Specify the credentials to the server, specify
a path and everything will be backed up automatically. This is done
through an SSH (encrypted) tunnel, thanks to pysftp, so your data is
safe!

automatically write them to the remote server? Simply click on the ‘Test
SFTP Connection’ button and you will get message telling you if
everything is OK, or what is wrong!

E-mail on backup failure
